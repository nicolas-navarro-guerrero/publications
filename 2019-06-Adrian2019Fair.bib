  abstract = {Numerous studies expect negative effects of computerization by artificial intelligence and automation by robots on employment (Ford, 2015; Frey \& Osborne, 2017). With advances in big data analytics and sensors even non-routine cognitive and manual tasks might be assumed by computers and robots in the future (Frey \& Osborne, 2017). Tasks that require capabilities in creativity or social interaction (Frey \& Osborne, 2017) and therefore empathy (Allen \& Wallach, 2012), however, are harder to take over by machines.},
