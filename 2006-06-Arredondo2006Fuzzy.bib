  abstract = {In this paper we describe a fuzzy logic based approach for providing biologically based motivations to be used in evolutionary mobile robot learning. Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy logic is used to motivate a small mobile robot to acquire complex behaviors and to perform environment recognition. This method is implemented and tested in behavior based navigation and action sequence based environment recognition tasks in a Khepera mobile robot simulator. Our fuzzy logic based motivation technique is shown as a simple and powerful method for a robot to acquire a diverse set of fit behaviors as well as providing an intuitive user interface framework.},
